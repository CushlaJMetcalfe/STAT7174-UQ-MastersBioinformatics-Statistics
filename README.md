Assignment 2 for STAT7174 Applications of Computation Statistics

The object of this assignment was to carry out a critical analysis of a recent scientific publication that 
includes a statistical test and a figure providing some illustration or statistical description of the data.
I chose the paper:

“The Impact of Transposable Elements on Tomato Diversity”
Domínguez, Marisol, Elise Dugas, Médine Benchouaia, Basile Leduque, José M. Jiménez-Gómez,
Vincent Colot, and Leandro Quadrana. 2020. “The Impact of Transposable Elements on Tomato
Diversity.” Nature Communications 11 (1). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17874-2.

The aim of the paper was to assess the prevalence and impact of transposable element insertion
polymorphisms in 602 tomato genomes and transcriptomes.
